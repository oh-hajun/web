  from late 2019 onwards, a subsidiary – as Mercedes-Benz AG – of Daimler AG.</p>
Mercedes-Benz is known for producing luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles.
The headquarters is in Stuttgart,Baden-Württemberg.
The name first appeared in 1926 as Daimler-Benz.<p> In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest seller of
premium vehicles in the world,
having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.</p>
<p>The company's origins come from Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's
1901 Mercedes and Karl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen,
which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile.</p>
The fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin.
<p>The slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".</p>
